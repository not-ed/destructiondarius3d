About
</h1>

Destruction Darius 3D is a 3D first-person remake of [Destruction Darius](https://gamejolt.com/games/destruction-darius/80097), a 2D action-arcade game made by content creator [3kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/user/3kliksphilip) for a game jam. This remake features all 4 campaigns from the original game to play through with the added quirks and approaches to gameplay that adding a 3rd dimension provides, complete with both existing scoring modes, and additional custom level functionality when used in conjunction with the [Darius Editor](https://github.com/not-ed/dariuseditor). This was all achieved using only Unreal Engine blueprints, and it was made a personal rule during the games's development not to use C++ in an attempt to better understand how Unreal Engine in particular worked at the time.
<br><br>
This game uses assets from the original [Destruction Darius](https://gamejolt.com/games/destruction-darius/80097), which was created by [3kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/user/3kliksphilip) - Permission was obtained at the time of creation for the use of the original game's assets where appropriate.
